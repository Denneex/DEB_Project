DATA ENGINEERING BOOTCAMP Project.
# Milestone / Goal
## 1 - Airflow Service in the Cloud. #

# Description Bootcamp Module
Have a running Airflow instance (latest
stable release) on any Cloud provider; 
the instance can be implemented as a
managed service or as a Dockerized
application or use the provided Terraform
Template. All options are valid.


## 2 - Database connection with Airflow. #
# Description Bootcamp Module
Create a secure, persistent connection
from your implemented Airflow instance to
any Cloud Database Instance. You must
implement a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
to populate Database Instance.

## 3 - ETL using a pipeline with Spark. #
# Description Bootcamp Module
Create the jobs, and DAG steps and
implement the required transformations
with Spark as a supporting framework.

## 4 - Data Warehouse Management. #
# Description Bootcamp Module
Create a Data Warehouse structure (we
are suggesting some structure options in
Step 6 of the Data Pipeline - The
end-to-end solution section) for an external
analytics team to be able to consume such
Data Warehouse entities.

## 5 - Dry Run / Presentation. #
# Description Bootcamp Module
Showcase and demonstrate the outcome
of the end-to-end solution in a live
presentation to a panel of mentors/architects. 
Elaborate on your problem-solving and thought process. 
And explain your architectural decisions.
